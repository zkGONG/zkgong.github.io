            <img src="img/research/RuptureNet.jpg" alt="Research 1">
            <p>Earthquake dynamic rupture simulations are crucial for physics-based seismic hazard assessment. 
                However, due to their intricate dynamics spanning vast spatial and temporal scales, these simulations pose a complex and computationally challenging problem. 
                We aim to develop a surrogate model for rupture dynamics, with the ultimate goal of enabling dynamic earthquake inversion.</p>

            <h2>Quadlayer Krauklis Wave Model for Explaining VLP Tremors</h2>
            <img src="img/research/VLPtremors.png" alt="Research 2">
            <p> The excitation mechanism behind Very Long Period (VLP) oceanic volcanic tremors is still not well understood. 
                This project aims to develop a rigorous dispersion and oscillation model for a four-layer system that includes an inviscid ocean, a thin crust, a viscous magmatic sill, and an underlying elastic half-space. 
                Such a model could provide valuable insights into the dynamics of VLP tremors.</p>
