                Hello! I am Zekang Gong, currently pursuing a degree in Mechanics and Software Engineering at Sichuan University. I am passionate about using theoretical and computational methods to study geophysical phenomena such as volcanoes and earthquakes. My research aims to elucidate observational data through a fundamental physics study of the mechanisms behind these geophysical events.
