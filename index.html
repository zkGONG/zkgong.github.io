                    Hello! I am Zekang Gong, currently pursuing a degree in Mechanics and Software Engineering at Sichuan University. My academic focus lies at the intersection of geophysics, computational mechanics, and software engineering. I am particularly interested in using theoretical and numerical methods to study geophysical phenomena such as earthquakes and volcanoes. My goal is to apply these methods to better understand and explain observational data, thereby uncovering the physical mechanisms behind these natural events.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p><strong>Sichuan University</strong> | Sept. 2021 - June 2025 (expected)</p>
        <p>Major in Mechanics & Software Engineering, College of Architecture and Environment</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Deep Neural Network Based Surrogate Model for Earthquake Rupture Simulation</h3>
        <p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Associate Professor Chao Liang, IDMR, Sichuan University</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Feb. 2023 - Apr. 2024</p>
        <p>In this project, I contributed to the generation of a large dataset by running over 300,000 simulations, providing insights into the rupture dynamics process, including phenomena like supershear transition. The project focuses on developing a deep neural network-based surrogate model to accelerate earthquake dynamic rupture (EDR) simulations.</p>

        <h3>Boundary Element Method for Fluid-filled Crack</h3>
        <p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Associate Professor Chao Liang, IDMR, Sichuan University</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> May 2023 - Present</p>
        <p>This ongoing project involves reproducing existing work (Pointer et al., 1998) on fluid-filled cracks and further developing the Boundary Element Method (BEM) to solve multi-scale wave problems. The aim is to infer crack geometry and fluid properties from seismic data and simulations.</p>

        <h3>Quadlayer Krauklis Wave Model for Explaining VLP Tremors in the Gulf of Guinea</h3>
        <p><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Associate Professor Chao Liang, IDMR, Sichuan University</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Apr. 2024 - Present</p>
        <p>This project focuses on deriving a rigorous model for VLP tremors using a quad-layer system, which includes an inviscid ocean, a thin crust, a viscous magmatic sill, and elastic half-space. The project aims to provide a more accurate understanding of VLP tremor excitation mechanisms.</p>
